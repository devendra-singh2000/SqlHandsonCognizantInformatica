phone number of the customer. If the phone number is not available, then
display the email id. Give an alias as Contact_Info.  Sort the result set based on the customer name in ascending order.

(HINT : Retrieve data from Customers table.)

ifnull(Phone_no,Email_id) as Contact_Info
from Customers
order by Cust_name asc;
