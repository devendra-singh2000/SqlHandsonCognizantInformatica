Write a query to display the cake name which is not ordered by any customer. Sort the result set based on ascending order of cake name.

(HINT : Retrieve data from Cakes and Order_details records)

select Cake_name
from Cakes 
where Cake_id not in (select Cake_id from Order_Details
where Cake_id is not null
group by Cake_name)
order by Cake_name asc;
