phone number and address of all the guest who stayed in the resort for more than 5 days. Sort the result based on descending order of guest name.

(HINT: Retrieve data from Guest and Booking tables.Use fromdate and todate)


select distinct(g.guestID),g.name,g.phone,g.address
from Guest g join Booking b 
on g.guestID=b.guestID
where b.todate - b.fromdate > 5
order by g.name desc;
