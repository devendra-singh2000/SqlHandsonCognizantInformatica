Write a query to display the Cake Type, Total price and
average price of the cakes. Give an alias name as 'TOTAL_PRICE' and 'AVG_PRICE' respectively. Sort the result set based on ascending order of the Total_Price.

(HINT: Retrieve data from Cakes table. Use price_per_kg for price calculation)


select Cake_type,sum(Price_Per_Kg) as 'TOTAL_PRICE', avg(Price_Per_Kg) as 'AVG_PRICE'
from Cakes
group by Cake_type
order by TOTAL_PRICE;
